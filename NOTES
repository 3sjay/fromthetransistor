Section 1:

Do the board in EAGLE, it's free for hobbyists

FPGA Choice, Artix-7? Spartan-7? Ugh, all BGA
Spartan-6

Hmm, https://wiki.debian.org/FPGA/ says Lattice has an open toolchain

How many LUTs will we need, I think 10k+

I like ($34):
https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/xilinx-inc/XC7A35T-1FTG256C/122-1910-ND/5039074
33208 LUTs
1843200 bits of RAM = 225kb, should be enough. can swap on SD :)

It's BGA, but big pitch, should be doable on a two layer board, and overcome BGA fear.
Pin conpatible with up to 100k LUT.

For programming and serial ($12):
https://www.digikey.com/products/en?mpart=CY7C68013A-56PVXC&v=428
USB mini B

2x tricolor LED (one for each microcontroller)
SD card connector, need special hardware?

Ethernet PHY, MII Interface ($2.38)
https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/microchip-technology/KSZ8041TL/576-1619-ND/1534022

Jack with built in magnetics ($4.30)

Power over USB
Reset the FPGA over USB

Section 2:

We'll have to use Linux, there's no ISE for Mac.
Actually it looks like it's "Vivado" now.
Nope, ISE for Spartan 6, but Vivado for Artix 7
